Three cats ride in a Porsche. The engine purrs as they pursue an unsuspecting Mr. Hund down 
Hauptstrasse. They notice Mr. Hund heading to a local Baeckerei. The smell of fresh brot and gebaeck
hung in the air. They follow Mr. Hund into the Baeckerei and notice he's ordering an Apfelkuchen. 
The cats love all kinds of gebaeck so they begin to plot and scheme. As Mr. Hund stepped out of the 
Baeckerei with his Apfelkuchen, the cats hatched their master plan: distract him with a fake Doener 
stall and make off with the Gebaeck treasure. Two of the cats dressed up, in their respective 
Lederhose and Dirndel, to pretend to run the Doener stall! As Mr. Hund approached the Doener stall, 
the 'vendors' enthusiastically offered him a free bratwurst sample while the third cat sneaked closer
to the apfelkuchen treasure. The Hauptstrasse was busy enough that Mr. Hund didn't even notice that the third cat was grabbing the Gebaeck while he wasn't looking!

Three cats ride in a Porsche. The engine purrs as they pursue an unsuspecting Mr. Hund down Hauptstrasse. They notice Mr.Hund heading to a local Baeckerei. The smell of fresh brot and gebaeck hung in the air. They follow Mr.Hund into the Baeckerei and notice he's ordering an Apfelkuchen. The cats love all kinds of gebaeck so they begin to plot and scheme. As Mr. Hund stepped out of the Baeckerei with his Apfelkuchen, the cats hatched their master plan: distract him with a fake Doener stall and make off with the Gebaeck treasure.
